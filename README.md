Purpose: 
“Why don’t they just learn english?”, is a question that many people ask when it comes to immigration issues. The answer: it’s harder than you think. More and more immigrants take tremendous efforts in learning english and adjusting to a new life and a new home in the U.S. because doing so allows them to have a better career and a stable life. However, immigrants are faced with multiple societal and economic barriers that prevent them from doing so: one being ethnic enclaves like Chinatown. 
 
Although ethnic enclaves facilitate coping with a new environment and make it easier to continue speaking a native language when suddenly put into a foreign environment, it can prevent immigrants from fully integrating into American society and further limit their economic opportunities. Not to mention, there is a lack of resources and information to help introduce immigrants to the huge world outside their neighborhoods.
 
Our app is a solution to this huge dilemma. Utilizing an AI chat bot, it motivates immigrants to interact with the diverse communities outside their ethnic enclaves through several agendas. First, the app helps them to adjust to life in the U.S by presenting tailored information on employment, education, and learning english. Most importantly, the app encourages users to connect with people they identify with through finding local culture clubs and supporting communities.
